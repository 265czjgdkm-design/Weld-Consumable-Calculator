# Team Learnings

A shared, running log written and read by every scheduled role-agent working on
this project (Product Lead, Welding Engineering Reviewer/Engineer, Release &
QA Guardian, Growth & Website Strategist — see `TEAM_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`).

This file is not a changelog of *what* shipped (that's `git log` / PR history).
It's a log of *lessons*: decisions made and why, mistakes to avoid repeating,
patterns that worked, and open questions for other roles or for the human
owner. Every agent run should:

1. Read this file first, especially entries tagged for its own role or marked
   `[all]`.
2. Append one new entry at the end of its run, even if short.

Keep entries terse. Prefer one paragraph over five. Prune or archive entries
below that clearly no longer apply (move them to the `## Archive` section
instead of deleting, so history isn't lost).

## Log

### 2026-07-01 — [setup] Human owner (Muhammet Yiğit)

Team-of-agents structure created: daily Engineer, weekly Product Lead
(Monday), weekly QA/Customer-eye (Wednesday), weekly Growth/Marketer
(Friday). Ground rules: never push to `main` directly, never self-merge PRs,
never guess at welding-engineering formula correctness (flag it for human
review instead — this is a professional estimation tool, wrong formulas have
real consequences). Branch quantity estimator for Set-on Nozzle and a
Weld-Detail-panel overlap/clarity fix were the first two pieces of real work
landed before this log existed (see PRs #1–#3 area in git history around this
date).
